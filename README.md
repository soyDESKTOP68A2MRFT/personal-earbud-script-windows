# personal-earbud-script
    usage-gui: python3 combine.py 
    usage-cli: ./combine.bat disconnect/connect/sync
a set of utilities to sync, connect and disconnect ANY airbuds
this is windows only, so there are no "complex" explainations, you must install python (prefferrably ms-store version) , and PyQT6 (from python's pip package manager)

install pyqt6:

    pip install PyQt6

and that's it, the script should do all the work, if you are into windowsish things, then edit the script to match the exact windows style of doing things

cheers!
